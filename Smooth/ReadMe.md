## Composition optimization

All the plots can be generated by *Composition.ipynb*





## Infinite-Horizon MDP

**Required package:**

-  Gym package for RL environment https://github.com/openai/gym

**To generate the figures in the paper:**

1. Generate samples to estimate bias and variance by running *RL_SampleData.ipynb*
2. Run *RL_Train.py* to solve MDP using algorithms in the paper
3. Run *RL_processResult.ipynb* to generate the figures in the paper
